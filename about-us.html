                    <h1>Boss!</h1>
                    <p>Once I discovered my passion for web development I couldnâ€™t get enough. I enjoy every moment because there is always something new and great to learn. The best part about programming that I enjoy is problem-solving because there is always a solution. For instance, thinking meticulously and making a plan that will lead to a working solution. I look forward to working with a company that will give me the opportunity to apply my programming skills. I'm ready to innovate, share my knowledge, and continue to learn.</p>
